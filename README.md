# AAMA-Lab02
## Malware Detection and Classification with MalConv2

This lab has been designed with the intention of familiarizing students with basic machine learning 
dataset generation techniques. Additionally, students are provided with the opportunity to train a
real MalConv2 model using the dataset they generate as part of the lab.

### Training
Basic training of the model can be done by running the `run.sh` script found in the root of the
repository. This file pre-sets the directories where the training and testing datasets are located,
along with the parameters used by the model during training.


### Grading
For instructors, the efficancy of a model can be evaluated using the `model-grade.sh` script in
the root of the repository. This will require the use of a dataset separate from the ones the
students have generated as part of their labs.
